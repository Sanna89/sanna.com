            <div class="fst-italic h4 blog">
              
              Anxiety is a common response of our body causing stress or tension. Increased
              heart rate, sweating can be few signs of anxiety.
              It is normal to have anxiety every now and then but if someone has anxiety
              disorder then they might experience stress, extreme fear and worries very
              often like day to day. A person can have more than one anxiety disorder which
              can even lead to medical condition. Some of the worst symptoms of having
              anxiety disorder are nausea, not able to move or run, fear of losing control,
              choking. These can be treated with regular treatment. Some might need only a
              psychiatrist but in some cases medical treatment would be necessary.
              During the pandemic, anxiety has hit almost everyone in some way or other
              even without the knowledge of the person. Overthinking is also one of the
              symptoms of anxiety and here is a law which talks about overthinking. Its
              breathtaking to know more about this law. A gist of the origin and an example
              of Murphy’s law is given below for a quick and easier understanding.
              Murphy’s law
              “If anything can go wrong, it will anyway” – the more you fear something,
              there are high the chances of it happening. This isn’t any mysterious power or
              magic; in reality, we expect that things should work out in our favor but when
              it goes wrong, we search for reasons.
              ORIGIN- It was named after Captain Edward A Murphy who was an engineer
              working at an Air force project in the time 1949. One day after finding out the
              fault, he started to swear to his technician and said “If there is any way to do it
              wrong, he’ll find it”. The project contract manager had a list of laws and added
              this as MURPHY’S LAW.
              There was confusion about whether this is Murphy’s law or Sod’s law. Sod’s
              law was coined long (hundred years ago) before Murphy’s law. It is rather
              better to say Murphy’s law is a simpler version of Sod’s law.
              
              Every day the teacher comes late but today when I was late to class, the
              teacher was on time. This is an example of Murphy’s law.

          There were actually many divisions in a production sector. As this was the small project, there was only one team working on all the fields. The first was the idea discussion and what were we exactly planning to do. Then we started to plan out the approximate budget and the location for the shoot. Once these were sorted out, we started the shoot. There were few issues too like we couldn’t finish it in the planned time but still we made it. Finally, after shooting the editing part was done and the video was released. So, this is a gist of my experience working in a musical albums and a short film.
Inspite of doing engineering as my undergraduate program, I did these because of my own interest in the field of production. I wanted to explore more of it and I loved working in these projects.

                  I have been working in Loyola-ICAM College of Engineering & Technology for about five years and I have known her for the last four years. I’m also her project supervisor and she is diligent and always committed to work.

Prasanna Mary has always had interest in the field of media. She has volunteered herself for works in writing. I’m also happy that she is currently working as an editor of a book and writing a blog too. I’m very sure that she will do her best in this course because it was her whole hearted choice in which she showed interest and is willing to work hard for it. She has a good grasping power and is an innovative student. Her percentage is about 8 (CGPA) and I hope she could do more than that. She is very good at English and her communication skills are excellent. She demonstrated her oral articulateness in the discussion sections that were conducted. She has shown good team work in group assignments.

As I have known her for a long time, her dream is to start her own production company and I have the belief that she will achieve it. At a personal level, she is a well- disciplined, committed and a problem- solver. Throughout the course, she has demonstrated great perseverance and initiative. Not only was she interested in and motivated to learn, but she also put great work into assimilating it to her own experience and developing her own ideas.

                  Ms. Prasanna Mary Selvakumaran has been known to me from her childhood days onwards, for
                  about 20 years. She is excellent in her communicational skills, she is logical in her analysis, she is capable of organizing programmes and she is very good at event management. I have found her to be obedient to her teachers, parents and other elders - which is a manifestation of the culture that
she has inherited from her family. She is always receptive to new ideas and she has an open mind
to discuss and resolve the debatable issues.
She is sincere, honest, hardworking and dependable.
I am sure these qualities will stand her in good stead.
